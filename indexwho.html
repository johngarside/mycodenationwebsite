    <h1>Welcome to Whonix OS</h1>
    <p>Whonix is a desktop operating system designed for advanced security and privacy. Whonix mitigates the threat of common attack vectors while maintaining usability. Online anonymity is realized via fail-safe, automatic, and desktop-wide use of the Tor network. A heavily reconfigured Debian base is run inside multiple virtual machines, providing a substantial layer of protection from malware and IP address leaks. Commonly used applications are pre-installed and safely pre-configured for immediate use. The user is not jeopardized by installing additional applications or personalizing the desktop. Whonix is under active development and is the only operating system designed to be run inside a VM and paired with Tor..</p>
    <p>
    <h2>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN</h2>
    </h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://www.whonix.org/">Whonix </a> is the distro we will look at.
    <p>
    <p>Whonix Os comes as a .ova file, which means Virtualbox will be needed to be installed.  N.B>Virtualbox is a virtualization system that is ran like any other software program.<br>Once Whonix.ova is downloaded it needs to be imported into Virtualbox.<p>
        This is done by starting Virtualbox and clicking the File tab and then selecting "import Appliance" and then navigate to the downloaded Whonix-Gateway.ova file, select it and click continue.
        Nothing else needs to be done. Maybe you have to "Agree or confirm".
    </p>This will import the Whonix-Gateway.ova into Virtualbox.  <p> the above steps will need to be repeated to import Whonix-Workstation.ova</p>

       Once both Whonix Gateway and Whonix Workstation are imported. It is time to run them.
       This is done by selecting Whonix Gateway and clicking the green-start arrow. Repeat these steps for Whonix Workstation to start the 'MACHINES'<P>

       </P>Start Whonix Gateway 1st and once running, start Whonix Workstation.
       Whonix Workstation is the visual operating system and this can be modified to the users desire. All the while Whonix Gateway is running in the background, keeping a whatch on the internet traffc making sure no internet infiltration occurs<p>

    <h1>Hello to Gnu Linux</h1>
    <p class="para">  GNU/Linux is an operating system, a large piece of software that manages a computer. It is similar to Microsoft
        Windows, but it is entirely free. The accurate name is GNU/Linux but "Linux" is used more often.
        GNU/Linux is not one company's product, but a number of companies and groups of people contribute to it. In
        fact, the GNU/Linux system is a core component, which is branched off into many different products. They are called distributions.

        Distributions change the appearance and function of GNU/Linux completely. They range from large, fully supported
        complete systems (endorsed by companies) to lightweight ones that fit on a USB memory stick or run on old
        computers (often developed by volunteers).</p>

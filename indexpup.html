    <h1>Welcome to Easy OS</h1>
    <p class="para"> Easy Linux, also known as "EasyOS" was created by Barry Kauler in January 2017, and the names are claimed for this project. The official host sites are distro.ibiblio.org/easyos and easyos.org.
        The official blog for Easy Linux is bkhome.org/news, and the very first post, announcing version 0.2 in March 2017 is in the link below 
        </p>
        
        
        <p>Where not explicitly stated or implied, code, text, artwork and concepts are copyrighted to Barry Kauler, with GPL license version 3.</p>
        
        <p class="para"> Barry Kauler has, to the best of his ability, uploaded a product in which all components are free to distribute. If any component is identified as not free, or has some legal or financial encumbrance, please notify Barry and it will be removed immediately.
        
        Regarding responsibility for what has been uploaded for distribution on the Internet, although Barry has acted in good faith, there is a complete disclaimer of all responsibility. This applies to everything, including code and documentation. You download and use Easy Linux with this understanding.

        <h2>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN</h2>
    
    <p class="para"><a href="http://bkhome.org/news/201703/easy-linux-02-pre-alpha.html">You can download and use EasyOS,</a> with no restrictions. How you use it and what you do with it is entirely up to you.</p>

    <h3>WHAT WOULD YOU USE IT FOR </h3>
    <p class="para">- Once downloaded, load EasyOS onto a USB and boot your computer from the USB. Once running, Easyos will allow you to browse the internet just as any other operating system    
The only difference is, you will be given an option to put your chosen browser in a 'contanier'. This means you could use EasyOS to do your online banking with security enabled. No external breaches to extract your information. When finished, EasyOS will give you a option to save your settings or start afresh next time you boot Easyos. No modification to the Host operating system</p>
<p class="para"> I have given an extremly simplified overview of EasyOS and recomend checking the above link for a more in depth tutorial on how to use Easy OS</p>
